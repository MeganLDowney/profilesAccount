# profilesAccount
A mock social network platform titled "PR0F1L3S" where one can login, logout, create and view a user profile.

The homepage is the login page where one can login to their account page or be directed to a page to create an account.
The homepage also contains a page in the navigation that displays all accounts with their name, photo, and location.
The last option on the homepage nav is to view one's account page that will display their info if logged in, and if not they will have no access.
